            <h3>1. What is spec file in MEAN stack</h3>
            <p>In the MEAN stack, a spec file in Angular is used for testing the functionality of components, services, and other parts of the application. It has the .spec.ts extension and is automatically created when generating components or services using the Angular CLI. These files contain test cases written with testing frameworks like Jasmine and are run using tools like Karma. Spec files help ensure the code works as expected by checking for errors early in development. For example, when you create a component, Angular generates a spec file to test if the component loads correctly or if its data is handled properly. You can run all these tests using the ng test command.</p>

            <h3>4. Which command is used to make a folder or file as a github repository?</h3>
            <p>The command git init is used to make a folder or file as a github repository.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>5. Why Git is fast in executing the commands?</h3>
            <p>Git is fastest in executing the commands because it is developed in <b>C language</b>.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>1. Why git is not showing git commit command while adding a file and it is showing command for unstage ?</h3>
            <p>Git doesn't automatically show the git commit command after you add a file because it expects you to manually run it. After using git add to stage a file, Git is waiting for you to either commit the changes using git commit or unstage them if you decide not to commit. If you're seeing unstage commands, it just means Git is letting you know that the file is staged and you can either commit it or unstage it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>2. What is the difference before first push and after first push ?</h3>
            <p>Before the first push, your code only exists on your computer in your local Git repository, and it's not yet uploaded to a remote service like GitHub. After the first push, your code is uploaded to the remote repository, making it visible and accessible online. This allows others to view or collaborate on your project, and your local changes are synced with the remote repository.</p>

            <h3>3. How the title tag is fetched to head and h1 is fetched to body when rendering a HTML file which has no structure ?</h3>
            <p>When rendering an HTML file with no structure, the browser automatically places the title tag into the head and the h1 tag into the body based on HTML parsing rules and defaults.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>4. What is the difference between href and src and why it is used in img and anchor tag ?</h3>
            <p>The href and src attributes are used to link different resources in HTML but in different ways. The href attribute is used in the <a> (anchor) tag to link to another webpage or file, so when you click the link, it takes you to that page. The src attribute is used in the <img> tag to load and display an image on the webpage. In simple terms, href is for links you can click, and src is for loading and showing things like images.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>5. Why there is three dots in if...else and do...while ?</h3>
            <p>The three dots (...) in if...else and do...while in documentation or examples are placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. 
                They imply that additional statements or code blocks should be added in those places.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>6. What is the difference between spread and rest operator ?</h3>
            <p>The spread operator (...) expands an array or object, while the rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array or parameters and used as function parameter.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>7. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?</h3>
            <p>The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>8. Why Components should start with Capital letter?</h3>
            <p>Components should start with a capital letter because React uses capitalized names to differentiate components from standard HTML tags.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>9.  While exporting a component why default keyword is mandatory? </h3>
            <p>The default keyword is not mandatory; it specifies a default export, allowing the component to be imported without curly braces, unlike named exports which require them.</p>
